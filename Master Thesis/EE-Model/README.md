# dengue_noro_rota

Code to reproduce the analyses from the paper ``Endemic-epidemic models with discrete-time serial interval distributions for infectious disease prediction''. Analyses for dengue, norovirus and rotavirus can be found in the respective subfolders (which each contain their own ReadMe file.)

The analyses require the `R` package `hhh4addon` which is available from the repository https://github.com/jbracher/hhh4addon.
