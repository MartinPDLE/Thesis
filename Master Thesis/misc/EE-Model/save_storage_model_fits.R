# This file serves to remove the maps and other unneeeded elements from the sts objects
# in all noro and rota model fits.
# This is to avoid storing too large files in the github repository.
# Note that these sts objects are not used anywhere anyway as in all obtain_forecast files
# they are replaced by the respective sts objects from the hhh4addon package (this is done
# because the sts objects in the model fits contain NAs which served to steer the subset.)
